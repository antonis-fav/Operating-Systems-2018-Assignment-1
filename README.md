## 🔹 Modes of Operation

### Interactive Mode
- The shell executes commands typed by the user.  
- Commands with **pipes (`|`)** are supported.  

### Batch Mode
- The shell executes commands that exist inside a **text file**.  
- ⚠️ The `.txt` file must be in the **same folder** as the source code (current working directory).

```bash
make
