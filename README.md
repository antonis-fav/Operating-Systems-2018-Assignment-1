# Operating-Systems-2018-Assignment


In this repository you will find a custom **simulator** of the classic **Linux Shell**, that was developed for the course Operating Systems (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki 2018).

This custom shell should perform properly both in **Interactive** and in **Batch** mode.

**Interactive**: In this mode the custom shell must execute the user's commands. Commands that include **pipes** are also supported.

**Batch**: In this mode the custom shell must execute the commands that exist inside a **txt file**. :warning: The txt file must be contained in the same folder that the source code is stored.

To run the code type in your terminal **make** and then  **./OS**.

If you want to access the batch mode with a txt file, type **./OS file.txt**.
